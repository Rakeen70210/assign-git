• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
    This file lets you choose what kinds of files you want to be untracked by git. For java, it will include the following:
    # Compiled class file
    *.class

    # Log file
    *.log

    # BlueJ files
    *.ctxt

    # Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
    .mtj.tmp/

    # Package Files #
    *.jar
    *.war
    *.nar
    *.ear
    *.zip
    *.tar.gz
    *.rar

    # virtual machine crash logs
    hs_err_pid*

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
    Fast-forward occurs when git can simply move the pointer forward without having to handle divergent paths. If I create a new branch based off master, make changes to it, 
    I can then "fast-forward" by merging my new branch into master. This is assuming we have not touched the master branch, else fast-forward cannot occur.
• Why should you have different branches?
    It makes working on different versions of code simpler. Your master branch should be a version of code that is most stable, with newer branches having code that may not be thoroughly
    tested and therefore lesss table. Branches can be used to implement new features and once you have finished adding/testing changes, you can merge changes into master.
    Branches also make collaborating with multiple people on a project more streamlined. Two people can branch off master and implement different features, once they are done 
    they can merge into master and see how both of their changes affect the end product.
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
    You can have as many as you want, as long as each repository has a meaningful purpose. Generally there is only 1 remote repo but with multiple branches.
